<p>We are excited to announce the <a href="http://aka.ms/reactnativewinrt">React Native WinRT</a> project, a new extension that makes it easier for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/">React Native for Windows</a> developers to call Windows Runtime APIs directly from JavaScript! With React Native WinRT, developers can light up experiences that take advantage of unique platform features on Windows.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will dive a little deeper into the technology, walk through some sample code, and show how React Native WinRT is already in use today.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt">React Native WinRT repo</a> is now public, and a preview is available for developers to get started!</p>

<p>If you have adopted React Native to build your Windows applications, you'll know that the final output is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide">Universal Windows Platform application</a>. This development platform gives you access to all the latest enhancements in the Windows ecosystem (modern UI platform, notifications, integration with features like inking and Windows Hello, etc.), plus greater security and reliability thanks to the sandbox the application runs in.
However, there might be scenarios where UWP isn't enough and you need to perform one or more tasks which are supported only by the Win32 ecosystem: working with any file on the disk without user intervention, reading a key from the registry, integrating a SDK which doesn't support the Windows Runtime.</p>
<p>In this post we're going to explore a solution that will enable you to get the best of both worlds: a React Native for Windows application which integrates a classic Win32 process. We're going to build a sample React Native application which will be able to read a registry key and display it. The goal is to display to the user values stored in the <code>\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion</code> hive, which contains many information about the currently installed version of Windows.</p>

<p>Windows 10 is one of the most powerful platforms on the market when it comes to supporting digital inking experiences. As such, the Universal Windows Platform comes with a dedicated series of controls that you can add to your application to enable inking experiences. Thanks to these controls, you can easily implements features like capturing signatures, text and shape recognition, etc.</p>
<p>If you're building a Windows application with React Native, there are a few options you can explore to add such a feature. One of them is using a community module called <a href="https://github.com/creambyemute/react-native-sketch-canvas">react-native-sketch-canvas</a>, which provides a Windows implementation as well. This module is based on Win2D and it enables the recording and playback of ink strokes. While this solution can be a great fit for many applications, there are scenarios in which you need more precision and better integration with the Windows ecosystem, like when you need to capture a signature. For these purposes, Windows 10 offers a native control called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.InkCanvas"><code>InkCanvas</code></a>, which enables powerful inking experiences. <code>InkCanvas</code> is specifically a Windows control and isn't exposed automatically by React Native. As such, we'll have to wrap it with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/view-managers">native UI component</a>, which is a feature provided by React Native which exposes native UI controls for Windows, Android or iOS to the JavaScript layer using JSX.</p>
<p>In this article we'll walk through the process of wrapping the <code>InkCanvas</code> control, with the dual goals of enabling your apps to support inking and walking you through the process of creating a native UI component, which can be useful for exposing other native controls.</p>

<p>CodePush is a service built by Microsoft, now incorporated into the <a href="https://appcenter.ms/">Visual Studio App Center platform</a>, which provides a way for React Native and Cordova developers to be more agile in delivering updates to their applications.
Thanks to CodePush, you are able to deliver a new bundle (which might contain updated JavaScript files, new images, etc.) without having to fully redeploy a new package. This means, for example, that you can update the content of your application published on a Store without submitting a new package and waiting for the certification process to be completed; or that you can add a new feature in your LOB app without having to redeploy it via Intune or another MDM solution to all your employees.</p>
